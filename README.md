## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The splash screen plays a **looping background video** with dimmed brightness.
2. The text (title, quote, and members) **fades in with smooth animations**.
3. After **1 second**, the **loader** (`loader.gif`) appears.
4. After another **4 seconds**, the page automatically redirects to `student_2.html`.
